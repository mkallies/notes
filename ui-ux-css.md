# Visual + Usability -> UI/UX/CSS

Read Refactoring UI.

Writing custom CSS is not great. Adds bloat to an app over time. Use atomic classes such as tachyons or tailwindcss. If using css-in-jss, styled components and styled system are a great combo.

Create design tokens for your app. Having an abstraction over your styles will help you create different themes. As an example for body text: instead of #444 or 'black', you call your color 'text'. When you create a new theme you can reuse 'text' for your new body text color

styled-system + styled-components + theme = ðŸ’¯
