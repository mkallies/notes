Notes on front end web development

# Accessibility

### Keyboard navigation

### Tab trapping

### Screen readers

### Semantic HTML

### Focus control

### ARIA

### Colors

### Resources

### Tools
- https://stuartsandine.com/lighthouse-circle-ci/ (also in performance section)

- [cypress-axe](https://github.com/avanslaars/cypress-axe)

- [jest-axe](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe)

- Checking color contrast ratios: [colorsafe](http://colorsafe.co/) and [contrast ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/). Chrome's devtools has a tool as well

# Analytics

### Google Analytics / tag manager

- Use gtag instead of analytics.js, this is the preferred way

- View -> View settings change All Web Site Data to Raw

- Create a test view

### Gatsby

- Use gatsby-ssr/react-helmet to set the gtag script in the <head>

- Use gatsby-browser onRouteUpdate hook to do page view events

  

### Setting up views with filters

- Mixpanel

- What to track and why

- Changes that can be made based on analytics

# Performance

### Metrics

Tools to get metrics:
- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest
- GTMetrix
- Pingdom Tools

#### Performance budgets

- Milestone timings: what is the user experience when loading a page?
 - time-to-interactive (tti) or first contentful paint (fcp)

- Quantity based metrics: based on raw values that relate to the browser experience
 - weight of JS bundle
 - number of HTTP requests

- Rule based metrics: tools that score your webpage
 - Lighthouse, WebPageTest, GTMetrix, Pingdom tools

Some budget examples:
- Must score 90+ on Lighthouse accessibility, performance and seo audits
- App must ship less than 170kb js on mobile and < 600kb for desktop
- Page must load in < 2s on ideal desktop situations and under < 5s on Slow 3G and low tier mobile phone
- SpeedIndex must be under 4 seconds

Use bundlesize or size-limit in your project to keep your bundle size in check.  Webpack can also set performance budgets.  If you are over budget and using React, you can use `React.lazy` for code-splitting.

A helpful tool is [http://www.performancebudget.io/](performancebudget) if you want to create a performance budget for your project.

You can use WebPageTest in your CI to see how a new feature will affect your app

- Real time user metrics (RUM)

- Prometheus + grafana

- What to track and why

- React profiling

- Chrome dev tools profiling

- Build optimization

- Have CI test for lighthouse performance (https://stuartsandine.com/lighthouse-circle-ci/)

# Testing

- Writing docs on how to easily create a test

- Jest + react testing library
 - Create tests that represent how a user uses the app -> integration tests

- Custom helpers to for writing integration tests (mocks for async calls such as graphql or rest, context providers, libraries etc...)

- Cypress testing
 - Visual regression testing
 - Accessibility
 - e2e flows

---

# Visual + Usability -> UI/UX/CSS

Read Refactoring UI.

Writing custom CSS is not great. Adds bloat to an app over time. Use atomic classes such as tachyons or tailwindcss. If using css-in-jss, styled components and styled system are a great combo.

Create design tokens for your app. Having an abstraction over your styles will help you create different themes. As an example for body text: instead of #444 or 'black', you call your color 'text'. When you create a new theme you can reuse 'text' for your new body text color

styled-system + styled-components + theme = ðŸ’¯

# Patterns

## General

- Write wrappers over libraries that are consistently used throughout the app.  This could be a network library such as axios or sending events to analytics.

- Use a component library that makes writing UI easy, scalable, accessible, consistent and themeable.

## React

# TypeScript

## Do not do

- Functional changes at the same time

- Be perfect

- Forget to add tests for types

## Converting to TS

### 1

- Rename .js to .ts or .tsx

- Allow implicit any

- Fix things

### 2

- add noImplicitAny: true

- use explicit any if needed

- add types from @types

### 3

- Slowly remove explicit anys and enable strict mode

- strictNullChecks

- strict

- strictFunctionTypes

- strictBindCallApply

- Do this in small chunks

- Try to avoid unsafe casts

## Generics

- When to use

- Type parameters

- Constraints
