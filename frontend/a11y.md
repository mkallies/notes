# Accessibility

TL;DR

0. Use automated testing - cypress-axe plugin
1. Make sure to use form labels
2. Use alt text in your images
3. Don't leave buttons and links empty
4. Use buttons and links appropriately
5. Test your site with a screenreader
6. Navigate your website with the tab key

### Debugging

- Use a11y web extensions (axe for chrome or firefox)
- You can use Chrome's dev tool audit for a11y but axe's chrome extension goes into more detail. They both use axe engine at the core.
- Check color contrast (axe checks for this)
- Test with screen readers + keyboard
- Use magnification & zoom

Use this small script to see which element is currently focused

```
document.body.addEventListener('focusin', (event) => {
  console.log(document.activeElement)
})
```

### Keyboard navigation

- Test for this using a screen reader

### Focus management

- Moving the user's focus as part of an interaction to alert them to new content
- Handle focus on disabled and mutated parts of the page
- Reachable and operable elements
- Can use tab, escape and arrow keys
- Visible focus styles
- Hidden/intert content

Tab index - similar to z-index

tabIndex="0" = adds element to tab order
tabIndex="-1" = remove from tab order
tabIndex="99329" = moves element up in tab order heirarchy

tabindex + role + name example:

Focusable, a button widget (not a DIV) and has an accessible name

```
<div tabIndex="0"
     role="button"
     aria-label="Close">
</div>
```

Intended for custom interactive elements, not wrapper DIVs

Things that need focus management:

- Dropdowns and menus
- Layers and modals
- View changes and deletes
- Loading screens

### Announcements

Notify assistive tech users without moving focus. Below are some patterns where you want to tell the user what is happening

- Asynchronous save/update/etc.
- Combobox usage/list filtering
- Chat widgets
- Title changes

Use ARIA live regions for announcements. You can interrupt or wait
https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#live_region_roles

Wait: aria-live='polite' / role='status'
Alert: aria-live='assertive' / role='alert'

### Semantic HTML

Use it! This will make a11y much easier for you.

### Colors

Check color contrast. You can use axe for this.
