# Analytics

### Google Analytics / tag manager

- Use gtag instead of analytics.js, this is the preferred way

- View -> View settings change All Web Site Data to Raw

- Create a test view

### Gatsby

- Use gatsby-ssr/react-helmet to set the gtag script in the <head>

- Use gatsby-browser onRouteUpdate hook to do page view events

### Setting up views with filters

- Mixpanel

- What to track and why

- Changes that can be made based on analytics
